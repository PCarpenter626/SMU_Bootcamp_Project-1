# Matt's Code of Project 1
This code is to add temperature, windspeed and humidity to the wildfire dataset, and create a few visualizations from the data
By default, git will save graphs used to "SMU_Bootcamp_Project-1/Output_Data/". CSV saves are markdowns by default, but can be made code by pressing y on the selected cells

## Instructions for operation
Before beginning ensure that "MW Cali_fires", "weather_daily.csv" and "california_wildfire_data_cleaned.csv" are all in the same folder
"weather_daily.csv" was taken as an API from open-meteo.com, and breifly transformed by myself on a seperate notebook
"california_wildfire_data_cleaned.csv" is a product from a fellow student Dagim Girma

1. Pip install necessary modules, including scipy and seaborn
2. Ensure "plt.savefig" and "to_csv" is saving to the location you want, depending on where you are running. By default graphs will save to "SMU_Bootcamp_Project-1/Output_Data/"
3. Run code from top to bottom, make sure imports are fully run before running later blocks
4. Ensure figures and CSVs have saved to folder properly

## Notes and Credits
1. As mentioned before, "california_wildfire_data_cleaned.csv" was made by classmate Dagim Girma
2. "weather_daily.csv" was taken as an API from open-meteo.com, and breifly transformed by myself on a seperate notebook
3. Stack overflow was used extensively throughout writing of the code
4. Code was regularly pulled and modified from my earlier homeworks, particularly homework 5
