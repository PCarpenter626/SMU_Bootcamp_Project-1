# SMU_Bootcamp_Project-1: California Wildfire Analysis

## Overview
This is our first group project where we showcase the information we've learned thus far. For our project we chose to analyze the California wildfires from 2013 - present times.
We started by creating the following reserach questions:
- How have wildfire occurrenceds changed in California from 2013 - current?
- What is the total acres burned per year?
- How long do wildfires typicallay last, and has this changed over the years?

#### From our reserach questions, We came up with different Hypothesis that we teamed up to breakdown.
- Does the temperature, humidity and time of year have a correlationwith the number of acres burned?
- How does the wildfires affect the Air Quality
- Does the number of First Responders have a correlation witht the number of acres burned?
- Is there a correlation between acres burned and fatalities?
- Which California counties have Experienced the highest numebr of wildfires?
