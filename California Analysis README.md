# SMU_Bootcamp_Project-1: California Wildfire Analysis

## Overview
This is our first group project where we showcase the information we've learned thus far. For our project we chose to analyze the California wildfires from 2013 - present times.

We started by creating the following reserach questions:
- How have wildfire occurrenceds changed in California from 2013 - current?
- What is the total acres burned per year?
- How long do wildfires typicallay last, and has this changed over the years?
-  Which California counties have Experienced the highest numebr of wildfires?
-  How do firefighting resurces impact containment time?

#### From our reserach questions, We came up with different Hypothesis and a statistical summary that we teamed up to breakdown.
- Yearly Summary Statistics such as acres and counties burned, The Personanel involved, the structures damaged/ destroyed and the average length of Wildfires per year. - Tiya
-  Does the temperature, humidity and time of year have a correlation with the number of acres burned? - Matt
- How does the wildfires affect the Air Quality - Ricia
- Does the number of First Responders have a correlation witht the number of acres burned? - Patrick
