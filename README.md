# SMU_Bootcamp_Project-1
 The first project (SMU Group Project 1)
Created with results and illustration plotted for the California Wildfires of 2013-2024.
Show results of how long the fires containment/extingused dates for years of 2013-2024.
Hypothesis- 
According to the graphs shown containment of California fires leaves a summary of environmental impacts, such as the severity of the fire, the time it took for containment and the vegetation of the land how compromised was the soil. 
 We will go over the time frames of the top five fires that were graphed. What top three soil implementaion is involved to create better soil to promote the growth of a sustainable forest. Water bars are needed for soil erosion to stop depleting of the soil base. Re seeding the soil and trees as well as shrubs to ensure growth of the lost seedinglings, trees and shrubs. Creating check dams to water the burned soild helps with removal of the burnt soild that has no life to regenerate growth.
Findings are Null due to the fact time frames differ for mutiple reasoning factors that depict location, wheather, climate change, erosoin, the ecosystem complexity, species richness, and polarization.
